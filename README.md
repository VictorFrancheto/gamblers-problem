# Gamblers_Problem

A player pays 5 dollars to participate in a dice game, competing against an opponent to see who rolls the higher number. Both the player and the opponent each roll a die, and the following prize rules are established:

- **If the player's roll is higher**, they win twice the difference between their roll and the opponent's.
- **If the player's roll is equal to or lower than the opponent's**, they win nothing.

What do you think of this game? Is it worthwhile for the player?
